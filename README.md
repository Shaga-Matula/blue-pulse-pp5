## Note on Business Model

To enhance user interaction, our design approach incorporates succinct 10-second previews for each song. This deliberate choice aims to offer users a glimpse into the musical journey while encouraging them to consider acquiring the complete CD for a comprehensive experience of each track. The user interface is thoughtfully structured to guide users through this informative process, emphasizing the value derived from the entirety of the music collection.

In the context of this Code Institute project, all songs have been released for your perusal. However, please be aware that in a live environment, users would encounter 10-second samples. This deliberate design choice aims to ensure a streamlined and efficient user experience, with complete versions available for more in-depth exploration or in real-world scenarios. Also, we would greatly appreciate any feedback regarding the songs.

# Introduction

The creator of the Blue Pulse project is Paul Gleeson, a dedicated student at Code Institute. This project takes a lighthearted approach to present a fictional band named Blue Pulse. Although the band itself is a creation of imagination (Fingers Gleeson), the music is authentic, recorded by the group in home studios over the years.

The primary objective is to share the music far and wide, with the hope that someone might resonate with a song or two, potentially paving the way to record these tracks professionally in a genuine music studio. The visuals, including merchandise and branding, have been crafted with the permission of My Free Logo, adding a unique and polished dimension to the project.

# Project Description

Blue Pulse is a band that creates soulful music that touches the heart and soul of its listeners. The official website of the band offers a range of features that cater to the needs of its fans and potential new listeners.

# Features

## Agile Aproach

- The Agile approach is a flexible project management methodology that emphasises collaboration and iterative development. It is widely used in software development but can be applied to various industries and projects. The Agile approach focuses on delivering value to customers through incremental and frequent delivery of small chunks of functionality. One of the key components of the Agile approach is the use of user stories, which are short descriptions of what a user wants to achieve with a product or service. User stories follow a specific format: "As a [user], I want to [action], so that I [outcome]". The use of user stories helps to capture the user's perspective and prioritise work.

- In GitHub, labels are used to categorize issues and pull requests. They can help you keep track of what needs to be done and what's already been done. I have created some labels and used some of the default ones. Labels can be used to indicate the priority of an issue, the type of issue, or the status of an issue. For example, "bug", "enhancement", "high priority", "in progress", or "done".

## User Stories

- The user story template in this project is a widely used format for defining user requirements in Agile software development. The template follows the format of "As a [user], I want to [action], so that [outcome]". The template is used to capture user requirements in a concise and structured manner, making it easier for the development team to understand and implement them.
- The user story template in this project includes three sections: Estimation Effort, Tasks, and Acceptance Criteria. The Estimation Effort section uses the Fibonacci sequence to estimate the amount of effort required to complete each task. The Tasks section lists the specific tasks that need to be completed to achieve the user story. The Acceptance Criteria section lists the criteria that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.
- The use of the Fibonacci sequence in the Estimation Effort section is a common practice in Agile software development. The Fibonacci sequence is a numerical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence is often used in Agile software development to estimate the amount of effort required to complete a task. The sequence is used because it allows for a more accurate estimation of effort, as it takes into account the uncertainty and complexity of software development.
- The user story template in this project is a useful tool for Agile software development teams. It provides a structured and concise format for capturing user requirements and helps to ensure that the development team understands and implements them correctly. By using this template, the development team can work more efficiently and effectively, resulting in a higher quality product that meets the needs of the users.
